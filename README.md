# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulation with Eavesdropper

This Python script simulates the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol with the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). The script demonstrates how eavesdropping affects the error rate between Alice's and Bob's keys and can be detected.

This script will output the qubits prepared by Alice, the eavesdropped qubits, Bob's bases and measurements, Alice's and Bob's keys, and the error rate between the keys. The error rate will be significantly higher due to the presence of the eavesdropper, demonstrating how eavesdropping can be detected in the BB84 QKD protocol.
